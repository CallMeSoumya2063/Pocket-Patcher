## What is Renderdragon? What is Patched Minecraft?
[Renderdragon](https://minecraft.wiki/w/RenderDragon) is a new rendering engine made for Minecraft Bedrock edition. It was introduced as a modern replacement of the old HAL engine, enabling Minecraft Bedrock Edition to have graphical enhancements such as [Minecraft RTX](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/ray-tracing) and [Vibrant Visuals](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Vibrant_Visuals).

Since Renderdragon's introduction, previously created third-party shaders for the HAL engine have become unusable, and therefore shader creators are developing [custom Renderdragon shaders](https://github.com/DominoKorean/Render-dragon-shader-list) by modifying Minecraft's renderer material files themselves. These files cannot be loaded into the game as resource packs without modifications (which we were able to, before Renderdragon).

Patched Minecraft for Android, first originated from YSS Group, is a modified Minecraft app for Android that basically lets you load these Renderdragon shaders as resource packs, without needing to edit your game everytime you want to change shaders.
