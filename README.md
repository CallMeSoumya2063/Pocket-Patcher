# Pocket Patcher
A ***cancelled*** bash script aiming to patch minecraft apk files, quickly and easily

# ~~WIP~~
**Current Stage**: cancelled
***Please migrate to [MB Loader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bambosan.mbloader).***

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to widespread unauthorised distribution of Minecraft patch often involving potential risk of malware, all my projects relating to Minecraft patch are now cancelled. This decision was made following the [official discontinuation of Minecraft patch by YSS Group](https://discord.com/channels/738688684223889409/1038294494661062686/1356588618663202907) in favour of the [modern and improved way of renderdragon shader loading on Android, **MB Loader**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bambosan.mbloader) and [their latest announcement on unofficial Minecraft patch distribution](https://discord.com/channels/738688684223889409/738689909786935336/1451198879214207048):
> ## Please note the following,
We have decided to clamp down on the distribution of unofficial versions of **Patched Minecraft**.
> As we hold the legal rights to the distribution of MC Patched and its namesake, we cannot in good faith, let third-party modified versions of the game continue to be distributed while their source and their credibility remain completely unknown while they continue to drag along an old standard for loading shaders into Minecraft for Android.
> 
> ### What this means going forwards,
> We are going to be taking steps against the unauthorized distribution of Minecraft Patched on all relevant platforms.
> If *you* are a creator or distributor of unofficial Minecraft Patched apks, we advise you to refrain from continuing to do so.
